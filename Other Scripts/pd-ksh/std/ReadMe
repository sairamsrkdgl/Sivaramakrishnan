	Notes on the Standard C / POSIX P1003.1 package

This package contains header files and library routines
to provide a standard C (ANSI) and POSIX enviroment for portable programs.
It supplements the existing libraries and header files
of a AT&T-derived Unix system (System V and BSD in particular).

Contents:
stdc/*:		The standard C header files and library.
posix/*:	The POSIX header files and library.
h/*, h/sys/*:	Links to the header files in stdc/ and posix/.
libstdc.a:	The standard C library.
libposix.a:	The POSIX emulation library.

To create the header files and libraries, perform the following
three steps in the stdc and posix directories:
	One of _BSD, _SYSV, or _V7 should be defined in the Makefile.
	Do "make link" first to set up the links from *.h to ../h.
	Do "make" to create the library.
Compile applications with -Ih, link them with the libraries.

	Notes on the standard C package
Setvbuf has not been ported for _SYSV yet.
The files <locale.h>, <assert.h>, and <math.h> don't exist yet.
Many standard C functions are not implemented yet.
These include strtol, strtoul, atexit, tempfile(?), etc.
The str* routines are by Henry Spencer.

Known portability problems include:
size_t and ptrdiff_t in <stddef.h> are int,
some systems (80*86) require unsigned int or long.
The method of creating <stdio.h> from /usr/include/stdio.h and stdio.h_std
may not work on some versions of UNIX.

	Notes on the POSIX package
Only headers and function required by the PD KornShell are implemented.
I do not intend to develop this into a full POSIX emulation package.
Unlink h/dirent.h if you are not compiling under BSD.
