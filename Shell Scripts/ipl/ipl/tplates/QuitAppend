Proc QuitAppend
===============

#   This proc will suppress the final page eject, so that additional
# IPL runs can be run later and appended, resulting in all the
# graphics on the same page.  Should be used only when running
# tipl and capturing the postscript output into a file.  Should
# not be used with pipl, since pipl routes postscript to the printer
# and could overlay onto someone else's output.  To print a file
# of postscript manually, use: lpr my-postscript-file.
#   Note that all settings, such as paper position, will have to
# be re-specified for subsequent runs.
