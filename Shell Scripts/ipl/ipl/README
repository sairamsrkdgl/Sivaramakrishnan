ipl	a 2-D graphic production system with table beautifier

Version 1.0, January 1990.
  This directory contains the sources and examples for ipl,
a 2-D graphics production system.  It produces scatterplots, 
lineplots, bargraphs, range displays, pie graphs, U.S./Canada 
maps, schedule charts, boxes, arrows, text, etc.  Produces 
Postscript or Sunview output, based on a user-supplied control 
file.  Included are a gallery of several dozen examples.  
Also includes:
  [] A table beautifier which is useful for taking plain text 
tables, spreadsheet output, etc. and setting in a nice font.
  [] A low-level subroutine library for producing nearly equivalent
graphics (with shading) on Postscript and Sunview.

 Developed on a SPARC machine (Solbourne 5/600) running SunOS 4.0, with 
Sunview and Apple Laser-writers.  Also verified on Sun-3. 
 I won't be able to send fixes or answer mail after 2-28-90.
For anyone interested in converting to this XView-- sunview code is
contained in one file only: sunv.c.

TO INSTALL: 
     Uses ~ 1116 blocks after building.
     Root permission is not required.
     Run the shell script run.install, which will: 
        build an install.h file 
	do a "make" on the contents of the src directory
     Executable will go in ./bin.  
     You will have to create links in a "real" bin:
	cd /usr/local/bin  (or whatever)
	ln -s $d/bin/ipl tipl   # postscript 
	ln -s $d/bin/ipl sipl   # sunview
	ln -s $d/bin/ipl vipl   # interactive annotator
	ln -s $d/bin/pipl pipl  # postscript to lpr(1)
	ln -s $d/bin/nicetab nicetab  # the table beautifier

TO MODIFY CODE:
     If IPL has already been installed and you are modifying 
     code in the src directory, just do a "make".
